We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

## Creating new content

We use hygen template to create all of our content for consistency. Doing this will scaffold your work and ensure the new content is apart of the build. It is highly recommended that you build content this way.

- `yarn new:common` creates a service in the common directory
- `yarn new:component` creates a new component in the component directory
- `yarn new:hook` creates a new hook in the hook directory
